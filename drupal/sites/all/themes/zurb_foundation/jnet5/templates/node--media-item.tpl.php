		<h2>Living Savior</h2>
		<p>Jesus is the Living Savior, sent by God to overcome the separation between God and man caused by sin.  We believe that Jesus lived an earthly life free of sin, dying on the cross to ultimately atone for the sins of all mankind;  that he rose again on the third day as testified to by numerous accounts and eye-witnesses, and that he is alive and at work today through his Holy Spirit, sent to lead us into all truth.  He is the Living Savior in that he is actively drawing people to himself to this day with the free offer of forgiveness to anyone who will believe in and trust in him.

		<h2>Risen Lord</h2>
		<p>When Jesus rose from the dead, he appeared to many, bearing witness to the truth of his testimony.  When we say he is the Risen Lord, we acknowledge that his resurrection was the greatest miracle in human history, and that through it those who believe in him are brought into a state of peace with God.

		<h2>Friend</h2>
		<p>We believe that Jesus is available to all that would seek him.  The Bible teaches that he loves us unconditionally and desires fellowship with us.  He asks us to trust him, to cast our anxieties on him, and to seek him for direction in our lives.  He promises to guide us through the seasons of life, never leaving nor forsaking us. The Bible say that when we believe, he begins a process of transformation within us, making us more and more like him and even allowing us to "bear fruit" for him as we become his disciples; reflecting his love and living out his specific will for us.

		<h2>God</h2>
		<p>Jesus is, and always has been God.  According to the Bible, he was with God and he was God before the Earth was even created.   He was "begotten", not conceived, and though fully man while on this earth, he never ceased to also fully be God.  To truly atone for our sins, he had to bear the weight of flesh, temptation, and suffering; thus making him a God who is able to sympathize with us in our weaknesses, and intercede on our behalf.</p>
